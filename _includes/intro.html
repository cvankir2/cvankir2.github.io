<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">Hi! I'm <span style="color: #5dad1d">Christine Van Kirk</span>, and I'm a current senior at the University of Notre Dame (graduating May 2023) majoring in <span style="color: #5dad1d">Computer Science</span> and minoring in Theology and General Business. Outside of school, some of my hobbies include skateboarding and traveling. <span style="color: #5dad1d">Feel free to poke around my website!</span> This was created by expanding upon the open-source code provided by github (https://github.com/github/personal-website), and my personal fork of this repository with its corresponding commits can be found at (https://github.com/cvankir2/cvankir2.github.io). I made this as a <span style="color: #5dad1d">side project</span> during Summer 2021 during the few days between working as a <span style="color: #5dad1d">research assistant</span> through <span style="color: #5dad1d">Auburn University's REU Program on Smart UAVs</span> and working as a camp counselor at <span style="color: #5dad1d">Camp Mystic for Girls.</span></p>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">I'm also excited to sshare that during Summer 2022 I will be working as a <span style="color: #89a672">SDE Intern</span> for <span style="color: #89a672">Amazon Robotics</span> in Boston, MA.</span></p>
