<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">Hi! I'm <span style="color: #5dad1d">Christine Van Kirk</span>, and I'm a current senior at the University of Notre Dame (graduating May 2023) majoring in <span style="color: #5dad1d">Computer Science</span> and minoring in Theology and General Business. Outside of school, some of my hobbies include skateboarding and traveling.</p>

h<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">This past summer (2022), I worked for <span style="color: #5dad1d"> AMAZON ROBOTICS</span> as a Software Development Engineer Intern, and I had so much fun! I worked as a member of their Workcell Technology team to develop proof of concepts for new ideas. I also had th e unique opportunites to take tours of running robotics-based Fufillment Centers and spend a day with a current Amazon Delivery driver while delivering packages in rural Massachusetts.<\p>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">Outside of school, I love skateboarding, yoga, and traveling. This past Spring (2022) I was lucky to be able to spent a couple months on the coast of Cartagena, Colombia while volunteering at an school-reintegration program for youth on the island of Tierra Bomba. Viva Colombia :). I was also luckly to have the opportunity this past Spring to walk 100km along the ancient Camino de Santiago in northern Spain with my brother and Dad. Buen Camino :)<\p>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">And that's a little about who I am!<\p>
