<h2 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}><span style="color: #5dad1d">About Me</span></h2>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">Hi! I'm <span style="color: #5dad1d">Christine Van Kirk</span>, and I'm a current senior at the University of Notre Dame (graduating May 2023) majoring in <span style="color: #5dad1d">Computer Science</span> and minoring in Theology and General Business. Outside of school, some of my hobbies include skateboarding and traveling.</p>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">This past summer, I worked for <span style="color: #5dad1d"> Amazon Robotics</span> as a Software Development Engineer Intern, and I had so much fun! I worked as a member of their Workcell Technology team to develop proof of concepts for new ideas. I also had the unique opportunites to take tours of running robotics-based Fufillment Centers and spend a day shadowing a current Amazon Delivery driver while delivering packages in rural Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">Outside of school, I love skateboarding, yoga, and traveling. This past Spring I was lucky to have the opportunity for several unique experiences, such as spending a couple months on the coast of <span style="color: #5dad1d">Cartagena, Colombia</span> while volunteering with technology at an school-reintegration program for youth and walking 100km along the ancient <span style="color: #5dad1d">Camino de Santiago</span>in northern Spain with my brother. It's a beautiful world!</p>

<p class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">And that's a little peek into what I have been up to recently!</p>
